*What does a line of content from Ocropus look like?*

When Ocropus analyses an image, it scans on a line per line basis. Thus, the html output by Ocropus is very line intensive in nature. A typical Ocropus content line looks something like:

{{{
   <span class='ocr_line' title='bbox 237 371 2058 412'>I am a line of Ocropus content</span>
}}}
