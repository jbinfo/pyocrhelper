Ocropus is a high quality OCR software which accepts images files as input and
outputs html text files. Ocropus is quite good at what it does. pyOcrHelper is
a python class which makes interacting with Ocropus easier for an end user or
a developer by taking care of all the steps which have to be taken before
Ocropus can be used:

   # determine filetype of input file
   # if (etc) pdf, convert pdf to images
   # convert input image(s) to Ocropus input image
   # run Ocropus on the input image(s)
   # format the Ocropus output (concatenating files if necessary)
