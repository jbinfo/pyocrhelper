*ABOUT*
----
Ocropus is a high quality OCR software which accepts images files as input and
outputs html text files. Ocropus is quite good at what it does. pyOcrHelper is
a python class which makes interacting with Ocropus easier for an end user or
a developer by taking care of all the steps which have to be taken before
Ocropus can be used:

   # determine filetype of input file
   # if (etc) pdf, convert pdf to images
   # convert input image(s) to Ocropus input image
   # run Ocropus on the input image(s)
   # format the Ocropus output (concatenating files if necessary)

You can checkout the pyocrhelper source from Google SVN with the following 
command:
svn checkout http://pyocrhelper.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pyocrhelper-read-only

*USEFUL HINTS ON OBTAINING AND INSTALLING OCROPUS*
----
Ocropus is available directly from the ocropus google code project at http://code.google.com/p/ocropus - if you want to configure and build it yourself, that is. A much better and easier solution is to use the [http://build.opensuse.org]openSUSE build service. Ocropus and tesseract are both packaged there for openSUSE and for some other distributions as well. Here are the download links:

Ocropus: http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=ALL&p=1&q=ocropus
Tesseract: http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=ALL&p=1&q=tesseract

In both cases use the binaries from home:jnweiger
